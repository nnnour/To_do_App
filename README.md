# Todo App 📝

## Overview 🌟
The Todo App is a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can create an account, log in, add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and move a top-level task under another top-level task. The application is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy, with SQLite as the database.

## Features 🚀
- **User Authentication** 🔒:
  - **Registration**: New users can create an account by providing a username and password.
  - **Login/Logout**: Users can securely log in to access their tasks and log out when done.
  - **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed before being stored, ensuring user data security.
- **Task Management** ✅:
  - **Add Tasks**: Users can quickly add new tasks to their list.
  - **Task Status**: Each task can be marked as complete or incomplete with a simple click.
  - **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
  - **Hierarchical Task Organization** 🌳: Users can create tasks with subtasks and subsubtasks, enabling them to organize their tasks hierarchically. Additionally, users can move top-level tasks under other top-level tasks, allowing for flexible task organization.

  - Built with the Semantic UI framework, the application offers a clean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive user interface.
